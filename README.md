# Emirates-Coding-Challenge


This repo contains code used in the Emirates Coding Challenge. Scripts have been placed in the folder named Scripts, and have been arranged numerically to show which script was used at different parts of the project. 

For example, Loading libraries is numbered 1, as it was the first script used. Then exploring (which is number 2), as it describes the exploring phase of the project in which dataset from the US Airline Tweets was examined.

- Script: 1. Loading Libraries --- This script loads the packages used in R
- Script: 2. Exploring --- This pertains to the exploratory phase of the project
- Script: 3. Dataset Formulation --- This script prepares datasets and tokenizers for use in our deep learning tasks
- Script: 4. Model Experimentation --- In this script, models are experimented with and saved
- Script: 5. Classification of Emirates Tweets --- In this script, the chosen models are used to classify @emirates tweets
- Script: 6. Twitter Extract --- The script was used to extract tweets that used '@emirates' tag
- Script: 7. Twitter Topic Modelling --- Some topic modelling was performed on tweets
- Script: 8. This is the RMD file that was converted to HTML5, resulting in the HTML version of the Walkthrough for the project
- Script: 9. This RMD file features the dashboard. It was converted to HTML5 for an interactive dashboard.
